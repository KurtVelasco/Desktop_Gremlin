Basic Troubleshooting

Q: Is this program compatible with later version x, etc?
A: No, this program is different from the others in terms of coding structure. Maybe in the future once I manage to make
   a perfect foundation so I can import all the other umas, but right now, each Uma is unique in terms of code.

Q: The Gremlin is big
A: Play around with this settings in config.txt ENABLE_MIN_RESIZE, FORCE_CENTER, ENABLE_MANUAL_RESIZE,
If it's still big, then I have no idea its prob your DPI/Screen Resolutions Settings

Q: Browser falsely detects download 
A: Try using a different browser or temporarily disable strict security settings. 

Q: Gremlin not following my mouse
A: Try lowering the FOLLOW_RADIUS in config.txt 

Q: Gremlin not animating while dragging 
A: Performance options in windows. Check "Animate controls and elements inside windows" 

Q: Transparency not working :
