# ðŸ“„ Gremlin - WIP Report any Screw Ups
A fun little WPF application that displays an animated sprite on your desktop. Agnes is just gremlin that I choose because of reasons (Best uma).
You can drag and shake her around, follow your curosr and be annoying as she blocks your mouse. This project is WIP 

For now, it only works for windows due to it being in WPF

The application uses a spritesheet and can be replaced with a spritesheet of your own, but make sure it follows the proper format through the config file.
