# 📋 Q AND A
**Linux Version?**<br>
A. Prob in the future
<br><br>
**Can you add X character?**<br>
A. I mostly base it off characters that I like so maybe, unless someone requested it through Kofi.
<br><br>
**Virus Detected?**<br>
A. I would be suprise if you can find a github download without getting false-positived by Virustotal/Defender. 
   I can assure that it's safe, but thats up to you.
<br><br>
**Can you Add X Feature**<br>
A. I'm always adding new stuff throught each iteration when adding a character.
